# config-help

A collection of tutorials for setting up and using computing environments.

Currently I dual-boot my laptop with Windows 10 dev channel and Debian GNU/Linux testing.
On the Windows side, I also run
[WSL2 Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Microsoft/Windows/SubsystemForLinux).

I use testing to get recent versions of TeXLive, python, R and such.
And the dev channel of the Windows Insiders Program supports GPU paravirtualization.
(Make sure the linux kernel is up to date for new things to work!)
