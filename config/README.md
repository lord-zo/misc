# Configuration files

On *nix systems, these can go in $HOME.
Some applications may support $XDG_CONFIG_HOME.

Worth mentioning that the `.gitconfig` file
can use the `gh` app for authentication.
This is configured automatically during `gh auth login`.

Make sure to hard link `wt_auto_theme.ps1` to `$HOME` and make executable.
