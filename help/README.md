# Help

A collection of tutorials for setting up and using computing environments.

Currently I use WSL2 [Debian](https://www.debian.org/intro/).
I would recommend upgrading to testing to get recent versions of TeXLive,
python, R and such.

And the dev channel of the Windows Insiders Program has goodies like
support for GPU paravirtualization for HPC.
Make sure your linux kernel is up to date for new things to work!
